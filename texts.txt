ur selection process How it works After you click the submit button, it’s easy to feel like your application has entered a black hole. So what really happens between when you apply and when you receive your decision? Once your application is complete, it will first be read by a senior admissions officer who will consider your application in a holistic manner, within its proper context. Strong applications will then be evaluated by additional admissions officers , who will summarize it for the Admissions Committee. These summaries, along with your entire application, will then go to the selection committee, where multiple groups of different admissions staff and faculty members will weigh in. At least a dozen people will significantly discuss and debate an application before it is placed in

 the admit pile. Student-centered This is all very intentional. The committee process ensures that every decision is correct in the context of the overall applicant pool, and that no one individual’s biases, preferences, or familiarity with a given case has any chance of swaying a decision unfairly. Our process is a student-centered process, not a school- or region-centered process. This means that we do not read your application along with other students from your school or region to compare you against each other; each applicant stands on their own. We have no quotas by school, state, or region. You are not at any disadvantage if other excellent students from your school or area are also applying. We also do not consider legacy/alumni relations in our process. At MIT, we try to be as tra

nsparent as possible about our admissions process. If you have any questions, just ask . You should really read these There have been over 7,270 blog entries posted to MITAdmissions.org since the site began in 2004. That’s easily several books worth of tips and tricks, hints and hacks, mea culpas and hakuna matatas . They’re all worth reading—but there are a few you really need to read. These are the blog entries that cut deep into our admissions process. Not only what we’re looking for, but what we want from you, and how much we care about the work that we do.

Of the total undergraduate student body, more than 3,500 students live in a residence hall on campus, and more than 1,000 students take advantage of living in MIT-approved fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups (FSILGs).

tudents may be able to obtain housing on a space-available basis. The residential system provides an environment conducive to personal development and academic achievement. Both goals rely greatly on individual initiative and responsibility, as well as on effective shared governance in the residences. Students work with live-in faculty and the professional staff in the Division of Student Life to support and create conditions that enhance student learning and personal growth. Faculty families live in each Institute residence hall as heads of house. These roles do not have formal academic or operational responsibilities but instead create informal associations with their residents. Area directors are residential staff, each responsible for supporting an undergraduate residence and serving a

In all of the Institute residence halls, graduate resident advisors support the faculty residents in providing personal assistance to undergraduates. With the exception of the all-female McCormick Hall, Institute residence halls have all-gender living facilities. Although first-year students are not guaranteed an assignment to a particular residence hall or single-gender area, every effort is made to assign students to one of their top three choices. Student governing groups establish and administer certain "local" residence hall regulations and maintain acceptable standards of community behavior. Residential student governments also organi

In each Institute residence hall, a tax determined by the residents is collected by MIT and made available to the residence hall government to help support such activities. Individual fraternity, sorority, and independent living group chapters have similar charges to support their extracurricular programs. The Institute believes it is to the great advantage of all new students to reside on campus in a residence hall. First-year undergraduates particularly gain from associations with upper-level students and participation in residential programs. Therefore, all first-year students are required to live in one of the undergraduate residence halls on campus for the duration of their first year. This excludes any fratern

These houses are located in the cities of Cambridge, Boston, and Brookline, and are conveniently accessed by public or MIT transportation. Many FSILGs have their own meal plan, some are cook-for-yourself, and others have chefs that cook for the entire group. In addition, members share responsibility for chapter house duties and work closely with alumni and the FSILG Office on the general maintenance and upkeep of the chapter facility.

Of the total undergraduate student body, more than 3,500 students live in a residence hall on campus, and more than 1,000 students take advantage of living in MIT-approved fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups (FSILGs). After the housing lottery for first-year students is complete, transfer students

may be able to obtain housing on a space-available basis. The residential system provides an environment conducive to personal development and academic achievement. Both goals rely greatly on individual initiative and responsibility, as well as on effective shared governance in the residences. Students work with live-in faculty and the professional staff in the Division of Student Life to support and create conditions that enhance student learning and personal growth. Faculty families live in each Institute residence hall as heads of house. These roles do not have formal academic or operational responsibilities but instead create informal associations with their residents. Area directors are residential staff, each responsible for supporting an undergraduate residence and serving as a supp

ort person for the students. They are charged with programmatic responsibilities and are on call for any concerns in the evenings and weekends. In all of the Institute residence halls, graduate resident advisors support the faculty residents in providing personal assistance to undergraduates. With the exception of the all-female McCormick Hall, Institute residence halls have all-gender living facilities. Although first-year students are not guaranteed an assignment to a particular residence hall or single-gender area, every effort is made to assign students to one of their top three choices. Student governing groups establish and administer certain "local" residence hall regulations and maintain acceptable standards of community behavior. Residential student governments also organize socia

l, athletic, and intellectual programs for residence hall members. In each Institute residence hall, a tax determined by the residents is collected by MIT and made available to the residence hall government to help support such activities. Individual fraternity, sorority, and independent living group chapters have similar charges to support their extracurricular programs. The Institute believes it is to the great advantage of all new students to reside on campus in a residence hall. First-year undergraduates particularly gain from associations with upper-level students and participation in residential programs. Therefore, all first-year students are required to live in one of the undergraduate residence halls on campus for the duration of their first year. This excludes any fraternity, sor

m. Fraternities, Sororities, and Independent Living Groups (FSILGs) Undergraduates affiliated with a fraternity, sorority, or independent living group have the option of residing in their FSILG facility after their first year. These houses are located in the cities of Cambridge, Boston, and Brookline, and are conveniently accessed by public or MIT transportation. Many FSILGs have their own meal plan, some are cook-for-yourself, and others have chefs that cook for the entire group. In addition, members share responsibility for chapter house duties and work closely with alumni and the FSILG Office on the general maintenance and upkeep of the chapter facility. Room and board at FSILGs varies per term and is determined by each FSILG. Each FSILG hosts a live-in graduate residence advisor (a gra

With the exception of Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Sigma, and Pi Beta Phi, Housing & Residential Services does not own or operate the FSILG chapter facilities. The FSILG houses are independently owned and operated by the individual alumni house corporations for each FSILG.
