Women's and Gender Studies (WGS) Housing Undergraduate Housing Graduate Single Student Housing Student Family Housing Off-Campus Housing Undergraduate Housing MIT is a residential university at the undergraduate level. Of the total undergraduate student body, more than 3,500 students live in a residence hall on campus, and more than 1,000 students take advantage of living in MIT-approved fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups (FSILGs). After the housing lottery for first-year students is complete, transfer students may be able to obtain housing on a space-available basis. The residential system provides an environment conducive to personal development and academic achievement. Both goals rely greatly on individual initiative and responsibility, as well as on effective shared governance in the residences. Students work with live-in faculty and the professional staff in the Division of Student Life to support and create conditions that enhance student learning and personal growth. Faculty families live in each Institute residence hall as heads of house. These roles do not have formal academic or operational responsibilities but instead create informal associations with their residents. Area directors are residential staff, each responsible for supporting an undergraduate residence and serving as a support person for the students. They are charged with programmatic responsibilities and are on call for any concerns in the evenings and weekends. In all of the Institute residence halls, graduate resident advisors support the faculty residents in providing personal assistance to undergraduates. With the exception of the all-female McCormick Hall, Institute residence halls have all-gender living facilities. Although first-year students are not guaranteed an assignment to a particular residence hall or single-gender area, every effort is made to assign students to one of their top three choices. Student governing groups establish and administer certain "local" residence hall regulations and maintain acceptable standards of community behavior. Residential student governments also organize social, athletic, and intellectual programs for residence hall members. In each Institute residence hall, a tax determined by the residents is collected by MIT and made available to the residence hall government to help support such activities. Individual fraternity, sorority, and independent living group chapters have similar charges to support their extracurricular programs. The Institute believes it is to the great advantage of all new students to reside on campus in a residence hall. First-year undergraduates particularly gain from associations with upper-level students and participation in residential programs. Therefore, all first-year students are required to live in one of the undergraduate residence halls on campus for the duration of their first year. This excludes any fraternity, sorority, or independent living group housing. Exceptions to this requirement are rare and are made through a petition process reviewed by Housing & Residential Services, the Office of the Vice Chancellor, the Division of Student Life, and the Office of the First Year. Institute Houses (Undergraduate) Baker House Burton-Conner House East Campus (undergoing a two-year renovation between Summer 2023 and Fall 2025) MacGregor House Maseeh Hall McCormick Hall New House—including New House 2, New House 3, New House 4, New House 5, Chocolate City, Juniper, French House, German House, i-House, and Spanish House New Vassar Next House Random Hall Simmons Hall Rooms in the Institute houses are engaged for the full academic year. For 2024–2025, the rates for the houses range from $5,325 to $7,315 per term. Fraternities, Sororities, and Independent Living Groups (FSILGs) Undergraduates affiliated with a fraternity, sorority, or independent living group have the option of residing in their FSILG facility after their first year. These houses are located in the cities of Cambridge, Boston, and Brookline, and are conveniently accessed by public or MIT transportation. Many FSILGs have their own meal plan, some are cook-for-yourself, and others have chefs that cook for the entire group. In addition, members share responsibility for chapter house duties and work closely with alumni and the FSILG Office on the general maintenance and upkeep of the chapter facility. Room and board at FSILGs varies per term and is determined by each FSILG. Each FSILG hosts a live-in graduate residence advisor (a graduate student hired and trained by MIT) who serves as a mentor and support person for the group members in residence. With the exception of Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Sigma, and Pi Beta Phi, Housing & Residential Services does not own or operate the FSILG chapter facilities. The FSILG houses are independently owned and operated by the individual alumni house corporations for each FSILG. Additional Information Additional information on undergraduate housing and application procedures is contained in The Guide to Residences and is updated every May. Additional information may be found on the Undergraduate Housing website or by contacting the team at MIT Housing & Residential Services. Information about fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups also may be obtained on the FSILG website and by contacting the FSILG Office, Room W59-200, (617) 253-7546.
